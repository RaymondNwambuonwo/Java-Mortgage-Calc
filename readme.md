# Hello ☕️

## Technologies Used
- Java 

## Purpose
- Gain an understanding of Java
- Focus on fundamentals.
- Build with fundamentals.

## Description
This was my first time interacting with Java and it was quite the learning experience. Please have a look at my [blog page](https://www.raymondnwambuonwo.com/post/hello-coffee) as I provided more context on my learning experience. In my learning experience I built a simple command line calculator using loops, if statements, and data types.

## Future Development 
I see myself working with Java a bit more in the near future, would love to add a GUI to this!
